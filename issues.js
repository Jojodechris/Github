// you are close on how you can store this information. First, our goal is to store favorited stories in localstorage so that we can utilize that information in the putStoriesOnPage() function
// to figure out which stories have been favorited already. Therefore, when we click to favorite a story, we need to store some unique identifying information about that story in localStorage
// then when we refresh the page, the putStoriesOnPage() function will be called and we will ask localStorage if there are any favorited stories. If there are, we need to toggle the favorited
// class on that story, and also add it to the favorites tab. 







// My accomplishment: On my html file as well as my  main.js file, i created a navigation bar to display favorite stories. In my nav.js file (line34) ,i implemented my <favorite> bar so that it  appears only for login user or once a user has finished to login.
// My accomplishment: Using local storage ,i successfuly allowed users to see their favorite stories once they click on the <favorite> nav bar.
//My accomplishment: In <favorite> navigation bar,  the thumb up appears with a red color  

// issue: When  i refresh the page, the favorite stories disappears. It is supposed to stay on the page the same way as my username stays on the page.
//issue: In <favorite> navigation bar ,i see  [Object HTML  ELEMENT]. How can i remove that?
